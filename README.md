I have implemented the missing methods in the app.php file and also added the needed dependencies in composer.json.
Everything works as expected, excepting the date format after the Excel export. I'm still trying to figure out why locally the conversion from timestamp 
to date works, but not in the Excel file.
Thank you and hope to hear from you soon!
